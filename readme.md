## Productive Desktop Config
The goal of this config is to create a more productive desktop workflow. This [write up](https://open.substack.com/pub/attentionseekingtech/p/a-vim-like-desktop-experience?r=3ho14o&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=false) explains the big picture.

Aerospace
Tiling WindowManager and way to bind apps to certain spaces.

Sketchybar
Top bar overlay that displays my spaces to reinforce my mental model of my desktop.

Alacrity and nvim (with tmux)
These are the tools I'm the least sold on so far but that I have seen some benefits and my hope is I'll see more. Together they allow you to develop all within a terminal environment. The motivating idea is that a single application with simple windows and overlays reduces the extra cognitive load of the many tasks involved in development like git and file creation and search/replace.

.gitignore
Just ignore the configs for github (gh), raycast, karibiner, and wireshark
